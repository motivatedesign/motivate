Locally shared objects are also files that are stored on your computer or device using a media player that is installed there (such as a Flash player) or HTML5 (or similar computer language), which is the language that your computer or device uses to communicate with our servers.</p><p>We use cookies and locally shared objects to deliver better and more personalized services to you. We use them, for example, to access your account information (stored on our servers); estimate our audience size for our advertisers; track the number of entries in our promotions, sweepstakes and contests; and identify which areas of the Service you have visited; and to assist in processing items in your shopping basket.</p><p>We may also match information obtained from cookies and locally shared objects with data provided by you or collected by third parties. We analyze this data both in the aggregate and in connection with individual users. This information lets us give you the services you want that are connected with your interests. We may also provide the analysis of our users (as a group and individually) to prospective business partners, advertisers and other third parties.</p><p>Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse it. Similarly, most media players that enable locally shared objects can be set to manage them. For example, Adobe’s Flash player allows you to manage locally shared objects (also known as “Flash cookies”) through its Flash Player Settings Manager. You may be able to control the use of HTML5 locally shared objects by reducing the amount of space you allow for them through your Web browser’s settings. Refusing a cookie or locally shared object will generally not interfere with your use of our web site. However, refusal may, in some cases, preclude you from using some or all of the features related to the Service.</p><h5>CLEAR GIFs</h5><p>We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies to help track usage of the Site. Clear GIFs allow us (and our service providers and business partners) to track page viewing counts and patterns, which we use, for example, for future service development and to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. We may also use clear GIFs within the context of certain emails to determine the effectiveness of the mailing. A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a message to other information about you, including the personal information you have provided to us.</p><h5>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</h5><p>We may use third-party digital advertising technology vendors to serve ads to you when you visit the Site. These companies use cookies and other web tracking technologies to collect information about your visits to the Site (as well as other sites and services) for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of advertisers and publishers.</p><p>You can opt out of receiving cookies and other web tracking technologies using a tool created by the Network Advertising Initiative. For additional information about the information that is collected by our digital advertising technology vendors and to know your choices about how to opt-out, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt-out.asp.</p><h5>WIRELESS ADDRESSES</h5><p>If the e-mail address you provide to us is a wireless e-mail address, you agree to receive messages from us at such address.

You represent that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.</p><h5>SPOOFING AND PHISHING</h5><p>A common internet scam is known as "spoofing" or "phishing." This occurs when you receive an email from what appears to be a legitimate source requesting personal information from you. Please be aware that we will not send you any email requesting you to verify your credit card, bank information, password, or any other personal information. If you ever receive an email that appears to be from us requesting such information from you, DO NOT respond to it, and DO NOT click on any links appearing in the email. Instead, please forward the email to hello@motivatedesign.com, as we will investigate instances of possible Internet fraud.</p><h5>ACCURACY</h5><p>It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information and to keep it up to date. <strong>We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or if you fail to keep it up to date.</strong> We will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or otherwise inappropriate for the Site.</p><h5>LEGALLY COMPELLED DISCLOSURES</h5><p>We may disclose user information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas.

Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to the Site.</p><h5>SECURITY/ENFORCEMENT</h5><p>We will take reasonable steps to protect the security of all Personal Information provided to the Site, including using encryption technology when appropriate.

Any unauthorized access to or use of the Site (or information collected and maintained by the Site) should be immediately brought to our attention at the e-mail address below. We will investigate, and if necessary take action to prevent or halt, any violation of this Privacy Policy of which we become aware. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.</p><p>If you contact us by e-mail, a "contact us" or similar feature, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send in transit.</p><p>If you create an account on the Service with a username and password, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password.

If a notification is appropriate, we will try to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, if we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.</p><p>If you send us any sensitive Personal Information, such as your credit card number, password, membership number or pin number, in an e-mail or into a web site or otherwise, and you are uncertain whether such request is authorized by us, please do not hesitate to ask us by sending an e-mail to hello@motivatedesign.com.</p><h4>Contact Us</h4><p>If you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy practices, you may contact us at: hello@motivatedesign.com or 646.400.5108.</p><br><br><br><br></section></div><footer><div class="page-center h-txtcenter"><a href="/"><img id="footer-logo" src="/images/misc/logos/svg/motivate_logo_main.svg" alt="motivate logo"></a><p class="italic-lead">Get updates about UX events, news, and more</p><!-- Begin MailChimp Signup Form --><div id="mc_embed_signup"><form action="//readytoreframe.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=9efac6c29df6c152fd6ba03a1&amp;id=03542f89f9" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" class="validate" target="_blank" novalidate><div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"><input type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL" placeholder="Email" required><div id="mce-responses" class="clear"><div class="response" id="mce-error-response" style="display:none"></div><div class="response" id="mce-success-response" style="display:none"></div></div><!-- real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups--><div style="position: absolute; left: -5000px" aria-hidden="true"><input type="text" name="b_9efac6c29df6c152fd6ba03a1_03542f89f9" tabindex="-1" value=""></div><div class="clear"><input type="submit" value="stay in the loop" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" class="button"></div></div></form></div><!--End mc_embed_signup--><hr><div id="social-links"><p>© 2016 Motivate Design, LLC.
