We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party websites, applications, interfaces, advertisements, services, advertisements and platforms. Once you leave the Site via a link or click on or navigate to an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy to determine, among other things, how they will handle any information that they may collect from you.</p>

      <h5>CO-SPONSORED FEATURES</h5>

      <p>Some features of the Site may be co-sponsored by another entity. If you provide information to us (or if we otherwise collect it as described herein) in connection with a co-sponsored feature, the information you provide may be shared with the co-sponsor.

      <h5>SOCIAL MEDIA FEATURES</h5>
      <p>When you contribute to a public area or social media feature on the Site, such as a blog or other communication or community tool or area, the information you submit will be made available to the general public. For this reason, we recommend that you do not submit any sensitive information, such your home address, phone number, other information that would enable other users to locate you or intimate personal details.</p>

      <h5>COOKIES, OTHER LOCALLY SHARED OBJECTS</h5>
      <p>Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your computer or device from a server and stored on your device’s hard drive or memory. Locally shared objects are also files that are stored on your computer or device using a media player that is installed there (such as a Flash player) or HTML5 (or similar computer language), which is the language that your computer or device uses to communicate with our servers. </p>
      <p> We use cookies and locally shared objects to deliver better and more personalized services to you. We use them, for example, to access your account information (stored on our servers); estimate our audience size for our advertisers; track the number of entries in our promotions, sweepstakes and contests; and identify which areas of the Service you have visited; and to assist in processing items in your shopping basket.</p>
      <p>We may also match information obtained from cookies and locally shared objects with data provided by you or collected by third parties. We analyze this data both in the aggregate and in connection with individual users. This information lets us give you the services you want that are connected with your interests. We may also provide the analysis of our users (as a group and individually) to prospective business partners, advertisers and other third parties.</p>
      <p> Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse it. Similarly, most media players that enable locally shared objects can be set to manage them.  For example, Adobe’s Flash player allows you to manage locally shared objects (also known as “Flash cookies”) through its Flash Player Settings Manager.  You may be able to control the use of HTML5 locally shared objects by reducing the amount of space you allow for them through your Web browser’s settings.  Refusing a cookie or locally shared object will generally not interfere with your use of our web site. However, refusal may, in some cases, preclude you from using some or all of the features related to the Service.</p>

      <h5>CLEAR GIFs</h5>
      <p>We may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies to help track usage of the Site. Clear GIFs allow us (and our service providers and business partners) to track page viewing counts and patterns, which we use, for example, for future service development and to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.  We may also use clear GIFs within the context of certain emails to determine the effectiveness of the mailing.  A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a message to other information about you, including the personal information you have provided to us.</p>

      <h5>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</h5>
      <p>We may use third-party digital advertising technology vendors to serve ads to you when you visit the Site. These companies use cookies and other web tracking technologies to collect information about your visits to the Site (as well as other sites and services) for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring the effectiveness of ads on behalf of advertisers and publishers. </p>
      <p>You can opt out of receiving cookies and other web tracking technologies using a tool created by the Network Advertising Initiative.  For additional information about the information that is collected by our digital advertising technology vendors and to know your choices about how to opt-out, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt-out.asp.</p>

      <h5>WIRELESS ADDRESSES</h5>
      <p>If the e-mail address you provide to us is a wireless e-mail address, you agree to receive messages from us at such address. You understand that your wireless carrier's message and data rates may apply to these messages, and that you may change your mind at any time by following the instructions in the Your Right to Opt Out section above. You represent that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.</p>

      <h5>SPOOFING AND PHISHING</h5>
      <p>A common internet scam is known as "spoofing" or "phishing." This occurs when you receive an email from what appears to be a legitimate source requesting personal information from you. Please be aware that we will not send you any email requesting you to verify your credit card, bank information, password, or any other personal information. If you ever receive an email that appears to be from us requesting such information from you, DO NOT respond to it, and DO NOT click on any links appearing in the email. Instead, please forward the email to hello@motivatedesign.com, as we will investigate instances of possible Internet fraud.</p>

      <h5>ACCURACY</h5>
      <p>It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information and to keep it up to date.  <strong>We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete information or if you fail to keep it up to date.</strong>  We will reject and delete any entry that we believe in good faith to be false, fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or otherwise inappropriate for the Site.</p>

      <h5>LEGALLY COMPELLED DISCLOSURES</h5>
      <p>We may disclose user information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose user information when we have reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other products or services, users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>

      <h5>BUSINESS TRANSFERS</h5>
      <p>In the event that Motivate Deisgn LLC or substantially all of its assets or the assets related to the Site are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of a merger, sale, consolidation or liquidation, customer Personal Information and Usage Information may be one of the transferred assets.</p>

      <h5>MODIFICATIONS</h5>
      <p>We reserve the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any time and will notify users of such changes or updates by posting the updated Privacy Policy on this page. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to the Site. </p>

      <h5>SECURITY/ENFORCEMENT</h5>
      <p>We will take reasonable steps to protect the security of all Personal Information provided to the Site, including using encryption technology when appropriate. However, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that this information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. Any unauthorized access to or use of the Site (or information collected and maintained by the Site) should be immediately brought to our attention at the e-mail address below. We will investigate, and if necessary take action to prevent or halt, any violation of this Privacy Policy of which we become aware. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.</p>
      <p>If you contact us by e-mail, a "contact us" or similar feature, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send in transit. </p>
      <p>If you create an account on the Service with a username and password, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password. It is your sole responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, exit properly from the Service and notify us when you lean of any unauthorized use of your password or account (or any other breach of security). We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision. </p>
      <p>If we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we will try to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, if we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. </p>
      <p>If you send us any sensitive Personal Information, such as your credit card number, password, membership number or pin number, in an e-mail or into a web site or otherwise, and you are uncertain whether such request is authorized by us, please do not hesitate to ask us by sending an e-mail to hello@motivatedesign.com.</p>
